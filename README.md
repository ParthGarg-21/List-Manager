# Project-Site-List-Manager
Created an interactive List Manager App, which (as the name suggests) maintains a list, where each item is a combination of an IMAGE, and its TITLE. One can also see the enlarged image by clicking on that item in the list, or navigating through the list with the help of UP and DOWN arrow keys. Used HTML, CSS and VanillaJS to implement this App.
